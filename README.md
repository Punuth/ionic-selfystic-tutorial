# Selfystic
"Selfystic" is an app to capture and share selfies/groupies with your social networks. A hybrid app using Cordova + AngularJS and Ionic. The app uses the [Swipeable Cards](http://market.ionic.io/plugins/swipeable-cards) plugin in the [Ionic Market](http://market.ionic.io/).

# PLAYGROUND LABS
Playground is a good way to start Ionic.

1. Visit play.ionic.io and you will see a boilerplace code.
2. Switch to HTML tab and delete what's in it.
3. Copy-paste the html-gist content to HTML tab.
