# Playground Labs
Playground is a good way to start Ionic.

## How to use
To run the code snippets visit [Ionic Playground](play.ionic.io) and;

1. Switch to HTML tab and delete what's in it.
2. Copy-paste the ```html-gist``` content to HTML tab.
3. Switch to JS tab and delete what's in it.
4. Copy-paste the ```javascript-gist``` content to the JS tab.
5. Switch to CSS tab and delete what's in it.
6. Copy-paste the ```styles-gist``` content to the JS tab.

You can eat, drink, and angularjs the code and see the response on the right-side live-preview mobile. You can repeat the same steps above for each playground lab.


# Selfystic Labs
Selfystic is a good way to jump start the ionic projects. You can get started by going thru the [Ionic Getting Started video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-UwOWB9Io4&feature=youtu.be) first.

To run on an android device;

```bash
$ ionic platform add android
$ cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.camera
$ cordova build android
$ cordova emulate android
```

You can repeate the same steps above for each Selfystic lab.
